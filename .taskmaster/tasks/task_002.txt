# Task ID: 2
# Title: Code Cleanup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove internal-only features, proprietary integrations, references to internal systems, and clean up debugging code.
# Details:
1. Identify and remove any features that are specific to internal use
2. Delete all proprietary integrations that cannot be open-sourced
3. Remove references to internal ticket systems (e.g., JIRA tickets)
4. Delete mentions of employee names and links to internal documentation
5. Clean up unused code, dead imports, and commented-out code blocks
6. Remove console.log statements, debug outputs, and development-only code
7. Use tools like ESLint to help identify unused code with rules like 'no-unused-vars'

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the application to ensure it still functions after removing internal features
2. Verify all tests pass after cleanup
3. Perform a manual review to ensure no internal references remain
4. Check build process completes successfully
5. Validate that removing debug statements doesn't affect application logging

# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove Internal Features and Proprietary Integrations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and remove all internal-only features and proprietary integrations that cannot be open-sourced.
### Details:
1. Create a list of all internal-only features by reviewing the codebase
2. Identify proprietary integrations that cannot be open-sourced
3. Remove code related to internal features, ensuring functionality is preserved for remaining features
4. Delete proprietary integration code and associated configuration
5. Update any conditional logic that may reference removed features
6. Verify application builds successfully after removal

## 2. Remove References to Internal Systems and Employee Information [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Delete all references to internal ticket systems, employee names, and links to internal documentation.
### Details:
1. Use grep to search for references to internal ticket systems (e.g., `grep -r "JIRA-" --include="*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,md,json}" ./`)
2. Search for employee names and email addresses using pattern matching
3. Identify and remove links to internal documentation and wikis
4. Replace specific internal references with generic terms where needed
5. Update comments to remove company-specific information
6. Remove internal URLs and endpoints from configuration files

## 3. Clean Up Unused Code and Dead Imports [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Remove unused code, dead imports, commented-out code blocks, and other unnecessary code elements.
### Details:
1. Configure and run ESLint with rules like 'no-unused-vars' and 'no-dead-code'
2. Remove commented-out code blocks throughout the codebase
3. Delete unused functions, classes, and variables
4. Remove imports that are no longer used after previous cleanup steps
5. Delete empty files or components that are no longer referenced
6. Clean up package.json to remove unused dependencies

## 4. Remove Debug Code and Development-Only Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Clean up console.log statements, debug outputs, development-only code, and other debugging artifacts.
### Details:
1. Search for and remove console.log statements (e.g., `grep -r "console\.log" --include="*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}" ./`)
2. Remove debug outputs and development-only code paths
3. Delete debugging utilities that shouldn't be in production
4. Remove feature flags or conditionals for development-only features
5. Clean up any TODO or FIXME comments that are no longer relevant
6. Remove any performance monitoring code that's specific to internal use
