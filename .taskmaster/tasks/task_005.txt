2. Search for internal domains: `grep -r "internal\.company\.com" --include="*.{js,ts,json,md,html,css}" ./`
3. Look for internal IPs or development environments: `grep -r "192\.168\." --include="*.{js,ts,json,md,html,css}" ./`
4. Check for employee names or emails: `grep -r "@companyname\.com" --include="*.{js,ts,json,md,html,css}" ./`
5. Review any matches and replace with generic terms or remove as appropriate
6. Document any intentionally retained references with clear explanations
7. Commit changes with clear message about sanitization

## 3. Test Complete Setup Flow [pending]

### Details:
1. Clone the repository to a clean environment (preferably a different machine)
2. Follow the README instructions to set up the project from scratch
3. Create a new `.env` file based on `.env.example`
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. Build the project with `npm run build`
6. Run all tests with `npm test`
7. Start the application with `npm start`
8. Test core functionality to ensure everything works as expected
9. Document any issues encountered during the process
10. Update documentation based on the experience to improve clarity
