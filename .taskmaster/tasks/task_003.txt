# Task ID: 3
# Title: Dependency Audit
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Audit project dependencies for license compatibility, security vulnerabilities, and remove any private package references.
# Details:
1. Run `npx license-checker --summary` to review all dependency licenses
2. Ensure all dependencies have open-source compatible licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache, BSD)
3. Execute `npm audit` to identify security vulnerabilities
4. Fix critical and high severity vulnerabilities by updating packages
5. Remove any private npm packages or references to internal registries
6. Update package.json to remove private fields and internal scripts
7. Consider replacing proprietary dependencies with open-source alternatives if needed
8. Update npm scripts to ensure they work in a public environment

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all dependencies have compatible licenses for open source
2. Confirm npm audit shows no critical vulnerabilities
3. Test that the application builds and runs without private dependencies
4. Validate that package.json no longer contains private registry URLs
5. Run all tests to ensure functionality is maintained after dependency changes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review Dependency Licenses [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Scan all project dependencies to identify their licenses and ensure compatibility with open-source requirements.
### Details:
1. Run `npx license-checker --summary` to get an overview of all licenses used in the project
2. Run `npx license-checker --json > licenses.json` to save detailed license information
3. Review each dependency license to ensure it's compatible with open-source (MIT, Apache, BSD, etc.)
4. Create a list of dependencies with problematic licenses (proprietary, non-commercial, etc.)
5. Research alternative packages for any dependencies with incompatible licenses
6. Document license findings in a report for the team

## 2. Audit and Fix Security Vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
### Details:
1. Run `npm audit` to identify all security vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. Generate a detailed report with `npm audit --json > security-audit.json`
3. Prioritize fixing critical and high severity vulnerabilities first
4. Run `npm audit fix` to automatically update packages where possible
5. For vulnerabilities that can't be fixed automatically:
   - Research each issue and determine the risk level
   - Update packages manually where needed using `npm update <package-name>@<version>`
   - Document any vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed and their mitigation strategies
6. Run `npm audit` again to verify fixes and document remaining issues

## 3. Remove Private Package References [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Identify and remove or replace any references to private npm packages or internal registries.
### Details:
1. Examine package.json for any dependencies with internal scopes (e.g., @company-name/)
2. Check for private registry URLs in .npmrc files
3. Run `npm config list` to identify any configured private registries
4. For each private package identified:
   - Determine if it can be replaced with a public alternative
   - If replaceable, install the public alternative and update imports
   - If not replaceable, implement the necessary functionality directly in the project
5. Remove any references to private registries in npm configuration
6. Update any build scripts that might reference private packages
7. Test the application thoroughly after removing private dependencies

## 4. Update Package Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Clean up package.json and related configuration files to remove private fields and internal scripts.
### Details:
1. Remove the `private: true` field from package.json if present
2. Update the repository field to point to the new public repository
3. Review and update all npm scripts to ensure they work in a public environment
4. Remove any internal CI/CD configuration that references private systems
5. Update any hardcoded paths or references that might be specific to internal environments
6. Ensure the package name is appropriate and available on npm if publishing is planned
7. Update author, contributors, and license fields to reflect the open-source status
8. Add appropriate keywords to improve discoverability
9. Review and update the engines field if necessary
10. Create or update .npmignore to prevent unnecessary files from being included
